# About this fork

Bunco was originally lead by Firch with contributions across the community. Now that the original mod is finished, Firch has move on from Balatro and is no longer maintaining the original mod. This fork is implementing critical (and non-critical) bug fixes that arise as modding continues to evolve beyond Bunco's final release.

This fork adds no additional gameplay content.
